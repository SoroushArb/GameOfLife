# Game of Life in C

This project is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in the C programming language as a tribute to the legendary mathematician John Conway, who passed away at the age of 82 due to complications of COVID-19. John Conway was not only known for his contributions to mathematics but also for his enthusiasm for subjects beyond the realm of math.

## Introduction
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by John Conway. It simulates the life and death of cells on a 2D grid based on a set of simple rules. This implementation serves as a nostalgic homage to my childhood, as well as a memorial to John Conway.

## Implementation
The entire game is coded in C, and the source code can be found in the [source_code.c](source_code.c) file. The program adheres to the rules of the Game of Life, which are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These rules create a fascinating interplay of life and death, resulting in evolving patterns on the grid.

Feel free to explore, modify, and share this implementation. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

**Note:** The project is created for educational and nostalgic purposes, and it serves as a small tribute to John Conway's influential work in the field of mathematics and cellular automata.
